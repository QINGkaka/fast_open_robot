# Experiment 3: RoboTwin Evaluation

Evaluation runner for the `Seen/Unseen x Clean/Randomized` experiment. FastWAM,
OpenWAM, and RoboTwin remain external repositories; this repository stores the
task split, shared episode manifests, model adapters, and result aggregation.

## Layout

```text
wm_eval/runtime.py             shared execution and result contract
wm_eval/adapters/fastwam.py    FastWAM in-process adapter
wm_eval/adapters/openwam.py    OpenWAM WebSocket adapter
tasks/                         fixed 40/10 split
patches/fastwam-eval.patch     minimal FastWAM evaluation-interface patch
run_experiment3.py             Experiment 3 protocol and reporting
```

The formal comparison is `no_wm` versus `wm` within each model family. FastWAM
and OpenWAM are not treated as identical backbones.

## Required Upstreams

The verified revisions are:

| Repository | Commit |
|---|---|
| FastWAM | `7faa71108368fbb3b6885649f112af607427a2d4` |
| OpenWAM | `f6d9f1059eb63a8a76dc60e07da2dad21615a161` |
| RoboTwin for OpenWAM | `0aeea2d669c0f8516f4d5785f0aa33ba812c14b4` |

Check out these repositories next to this repository, or set their absolute
paths in the configuration. OpenWAM is used without source changes. FastWAM
needs the included evaluation patch; it does not change model inference or
checkpoint loading.

```bash
git -C /path/to/FastWAM apply /path/to/experiment3/patches/fastwam-eval.patch
python check_upstreams.py --config config.smoke.json
```

After filling in `config.smoke.json`, `check_upstreams.py` verifies the three
commits, rejects unexpected tracked changes, and confirms the FastWAM patch.

## Evaluation Protocol

RoboTwin generates a manifest containing each episode's task, mode, seed,
initial state, and instruction. Every model evaluates the same manifests.

Experiment 3 evaluates:

```text
Seen + Clean
Seen + Randomized
Unseen + Clean
Unseen + Randomized
```

Each condition is run for both `no_wm` and `wm`. The runner stores the resolved
configuration, repository commits, logs, per-task success rates, aggregate
rates, and WM improvement.

## Configuration

Create a machine-local configuration and fill in repository paths, Python or
Conda environments, GPU IDs, and checkpoint paths:

```bash
cp config.smoke.example.json config.smoke.json
# or, for the formal run:
cp config.formal.template.json config.formal.json
```

Paths may be absolute or relative to the configuration file. The two local
configuration files are ignored by Git.

## Commands

```bash
python run_experiment3.py validate --config config.smoke.json
python check_upstreams.py --config config.smoke.json
python run_experiment3.py run --config config.smoke.json --split unseen --dry-run
python run_experiment3.py run --config config.smoke.json --split unseen
python run_experiment3.py run --config config.formal.json
python run_experiment3.py summarize --run-dir runs/<run-id>
```

## One-command OpenWAM Runs

### Experiment 3 selected-task protocol

The current Experiment 3 protocol evaluates the five tasks in
`tasks/seen_5_exp3.txt` and all ten tasks in `tasks/unseen_10.txt`. For every
task and condition, it replays 10 fixed manifest states 32 times with distinct,
deterministic policy-sampling seeds. No-WM and WM use paired seeds for the same
task, condition, state, and rollout index.

This is `15 tasks x 2 conditions x 2 methods x 10 states x 32 rollouts = 19,200`
rollouts. Set `protocol.episodes` to 10 and `protocol.rollouts_per_state` to 32;
setting episodes to 320 is not equivalent because that generates 320 different
initial states. Start from `config.openwam.exp3_15tasks.template.json`.

With `run_openwam_remote_formal.py --dynamic-pool`, repeated-rollout jobs are
scheduled at `(task, condition, state)` granularity. Each simulator worker runs
the 32 rollouts for one fixed state, then immediately claims another state.
Every rollout is stored as an immutable `sNNN_rNNN.json` part, so rerunning the
same command validates and resumes completed work.

Apply both `patches/openwam-session-isolation.patch` and
`patches/openwam-policy-sampling-seed.patch` to the OpenWAM checkout. The latter
propagates the recorded rollout seed through the client request into diffusion
sampling; without it, repeated rollouts do not implement the intended sampling
protocol.

### Legacy all-task benchmark

Both launchers cover all 50 tasks, clean and randomized conditions, and the
No-WM and WM checkpoints. Each initial state receives one policy rollout.

Run the 4-state smoke protocol first (800 rollouts):

```bash
cp config.openwam.smoke4.template.json config.openwam.smoke4.json
# Edit OpenWAM/RoboTwin/Python/checkpoint paths in config.openwam.smoke4.json.
python run_experiment3.py validate --config config.openwam.smoke4.json
./run_openwam_smoke4.sh
```

The formal protocol uses 100 states per cell (20,000 rollouts):

The formal OpenWAM protocol evaluates 50 tasks under clean and randomized
conditions, comparing No-WM and WM on 100 valid initial states per cell. Each
state receives one policy rollout, for 20,000 rollouts in total.

Configure the machine once:

```bash
cp config.openwam.formal.template.json config.openwam.formal.json
# Edit OpenWAM/RoboTwin/Python/checkpoint paths in config.openwam.formal.json.
python run_experiment3.py validate --config config.openwam.formal.json
```

On a 40-GPU machine, both launchers create 20 isolated workers by default.
GPUs 0-19 run RoboTwin simulators and GPUs 20-39 host OpenWAM servers:

```bash
tmux new -s openwam-exp3
./run_openwam_formal.sh
```

Tasks are greedily balanced using RoboTwin's official per-task step limits.
Each worker gets a distinct model GPU, simulator GPU, port, config, log, and
result directory. Results are checkpointed every 10 episodes. If a process or
machine stops, run the same command again; validated batches are reused and
only missing batches are executed.

Override GPU pairs or the output directory without editing the script:

```bash
MODEL_GPUS=8-15 SIM_GPUS=0-7 RUN_DIR=/data/exp3/run_01 ./run_openwam_formal.sh
```

Use the same overrides with `run_openwam_smoke4.sh` on smaller machines. The
smoke and formal defaults use separate manifest and result directories, so
their outputs cannot be mixed accidentally.

The launcher refuses to use missing GPUs or GPUs with more than 2 GiB already allocated.
Set `MAX_USED_MEMORY_MIB` to change that threshold, or pass `--allow-busy-gpus` only when
GPU sharing is intentional.

Progress is printed once per minute. Final artifacts are written to
`$RUN_DIR/summary/summary.md`, `all_results.csv`, and `status.json`. A complete
run has 200/200 task-condition-model cells and 20,000 rollouts.

The released-checkpoint smoke run only verifies the pipeline. It is not formal
OOD evidence because those checkpoints were not trained with this 40/10 split.

## Split-host OpenWAM Runs

For deployments where RoboTwin rendering and OpenWAM inference run on separate
GPU hosts, use `run_openwam_remote_formal.py`. It keeps one model server resident
per inference GPU, supports multiple isolated simulator clients per server,
dynamically assigns task-condition jobs, reuses completed result parts after a
restart, and monitors SSH tunnels with keepalives. See
[`REMOTE_PARALLEL.md`](REMOTE_PARALLEL.md) and apply
`patches/openwam-session-isolation.patch` to the verified OpenWAM revision.

## Outputs

Each run is written under `runs/<run-id>/` and includes:

```text
config.json                 resolved configuration
metadata.json               commits, protocol, and hardware
<family>/<method>/<split>/  logs and normalized results
summary/summary.md           success-rate table
summary/success_rates.csv    machine-readable summary
```

`runs/` and generated manifests are intentionally not committed.

## Extending the Runner

To add another model, implement an adapter under `wm_eval/adapters/` and
register it in `wm_eval/adapters/__init__.py`. The adapter must consume the
shared manifests and write the common result format through
`EvalContext.write_result(...)`.

Experiment 1 can reuse the environment startup, manifest, and adapter approach,
but needs a separate runner and per-rollout result format for 32 samples of one
fixed simulator state.

## Git Hygiene

The `.gitignore` excludes runs, manifests, machine-local configuration,
checkpoints, videos, and datasets.
